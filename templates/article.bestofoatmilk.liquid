<p>Thinking of making the switch away from dairy milk to Oat Milk? You’re not alone!</p>
<p>According to the Good Food Institute, Oat Milk is second to Almond Milk when it comes to the popularity of Plant Milks.</p>
<p>And oat milk can be a great option! It’s smooth, creamy and delicious on its own, in coffee or recipes and can have plenty of benefits! But, it may (or may not) be a surprise to you that just grabbing any carton of oat milk off the shelf isn’t necessarily a healthy choice.</p>
<p>The key is making sure you’re choosing the right oat milk.</p>
<h2>So, what is the healthiest Oat Milk to drink?</h2>
<p>Spoiler alert: we’re obviously going to say Elmhurst!</p>
<p>But don’t worry - we’re not just going to leave you hanging there and not explain ourselves. Elmhurst's Oat Milks are the best because of what goes into them, and just as importantly, what doesn't go into them.</p>
<p>Before we tell you about our Oat Milks, here are some things to look out for if you are considering other Oat Milk brands.</p>
<h2>It Starts With Whole-Grain Oats</h2>
<p>The best Oat Milks are made from whole-grain oats, aka the whole oat.</p>
<p>Oats naturally have layers, each with their own benefits like vitamins, protein, antioxidants, fiber and healthy fats. When you strip them away by refining them, you miss out on the goodness they have to offer.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Oat milks made from processed oat flour, oat extract or oat concentrate often have limited actual nutrition (or they’ve been fortified - which is another story), and can contain more sugar along with other ingredients you don’t really want in your Plant Milk!</p>
<p>If your Oat Milk is made from whole grain oats, it should say so on the package. Another easy way to check is to look for the 100% stamp from the Whole Grains Council, which you guessed it - you’ll find on any carton of Elmhurst Oat Milk.</p>
<h2>Why You Don’t Want Gums and Fillers in your Oat Milk</h2>
<p>While gums are generally recognized as safe by the FDA in small quantities, they affect everyone differently and really don’t need to be in your oat milk to begin with. Especially since many of us enjoy plant milks daily - on their own, to cook with, in our coffee.</p>
<p>So why are they listed in the ingredients of so many other brands?</p>
<p>Usually because they aren’t using the whole oat, or enough oats. Without those gums and additives, that ‘oat milk’ wouldn’t have the thick, creamy texture you’d expect from milk.</p>
<p>But, with our unique HydroRelease™ method we’re able to use more whole grain oats and tap into those natural healthy fats &amp; proteins instead. Which is why you won’t find any gums or other fillers in your Elmhurst oat milk!</p>
<h2>Check for Glyphosate in Your Oat Milk</h2>
<p>What is it and is it in my oat milk?</p>
<p>Glyphosate is most commonly used to control weeds anywhere from your lawn at home, to large farms for crops like fruits, vegetables and grains including oats.</p>
<p>In 2015, the World Health Organization’s IARC identified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen.2 Although this was later challenged by the EPA, ruling that ‘glyphosate is not likely to be carcinogenic’3 when used properly, research continues to fully understand its potential impact on our health and the environment.</p>
<p>Until then, one place you don’t have to worry about finding Glyphosate is in your Elmhurst Oat Milk. All our oat milks (and oat creamers too!) are Certified Glyphosate Residue Free by The Detox Project.</p>
<h2>Look Out for High Levels of Sodium</h2>
<p>We hear about limiting or avoiding added processed sugars and sweeteners when we can all the time, and rightly so. But what you don’t hear about as much is the excess added sodium that often finds its way into Plant Milks.</p>
<p>Why can so much of it end up in your oat milk? Usually to enhance the flavor and texture - or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Because many oat milks don’t actually contain that many oats and are highly processed, salt gets added along with other additives (that can also add to the sodium) to make it more palatable.</p>
<p>We do add just a touch of salt to some of our products, but no more than is needed to perfectly balance the flavor of your Plant Milk.</p>
<h2>What Ingredients are in Elmhurst’s Oat Milks?</h2>
<p>You won’t find these added and unnecessary added ingredients in your Elmhurst Oat Milk! That’s because we use up to 25g of whole grain oats in every unbelievably creamy and nutritious glass.</p>
<p>Plus, our unique HydroRelease™ method ensures that our Plant Milks retain more of their nutritional value because they're not over-processed. So with Elmhurst Oat Milk, you get all the benefits and creamy deliciousness of real whole grain oats without any junk.</p>
